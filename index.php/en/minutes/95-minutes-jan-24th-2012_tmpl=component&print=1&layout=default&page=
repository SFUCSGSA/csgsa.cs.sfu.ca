<h3>Committee Reports</h3>
<ol><ol>
<li>Report From Zahra Vaseqi about GSS meeting:
<ul>
<li>Referendum on 2 questions:
<ul>
<li>Increasing membership fee due to inflation by 2.9%
<ul>
<li>for full time students from $33.00 to $33.96</li>
<li>for part time students from $17.50 to $18.00</li>

<li>Announcement of a workshop in SFU about academic dishonesty policy for grad students (Jan 25th 3:00-4:00)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Report from Mark Roth about TSSU meeting : <br /> The TSSU has had several meetings with the University last semester with no progress. The general feeling is that the University is trying to stall for as long as possible in order to keep the students on an expired (unfavorable) contract. The University feels that it can get away with this since there is not much public debate around this issue. The TSSU is therefore planning strike/job action round table on Feb 21.<br /> Some of the big things that the TSSU is trying to bargain for is a better priority mechanism for TA appointments for Grad students. A large chunk of TA funding actually goes to undergraduates or non-SFU grad students.</li>
